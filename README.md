2. *Checkbox to indicate whether to include a number*
3. *Dropdown to indicate what symbol to include*

## Class
*List the name of the class(es) you're using, e.g. `Form.php`, `Password.php`, etc.*

## Code style divergences
*List any divergences from PSR-1/PSR-2 and course guidelines on code style*

## Notes for instructor
*Any notes for me to refer to while grading; if none, omit this section*
